# Introduction

AGL Automotive Grade Linux Automotive Grade Linux is a collaborative open
source project that is bringing together automakers, suppliers and technology
companies to accelerate the development and adoption of a fully open software
stack for the connected car.

The purpose of this section is to help developers to natively develop and debug
AGL microservices. Thanks to OBS, packages for debian/ubuntu, openSUSE and
fedora distributions are available and can be installed on developer host.

At first hand, the idea is to easily handle native development of AGL services
and at second hand to run the same services on targets/boards.
