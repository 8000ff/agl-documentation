# Introduction

AGL Automotive Grade Linux Automotive Grade Linux is a collaborative open
source project that is bringing together automakers, suppliers and technology
companies to accelerate the development and adoption of a fully open software
stack for the connected car.

The purpose of this section is to help to natively install AGL microservices
thanks to OBS packages and so for debian/ubuntu, openSUSE and fedora distributions.

At first hand, the idea is to easily handle native
development and at second hand to run the result on targets.
